# 🎨 Codeforces Redesign Project  
*Modernizing the Competitive Programming Experience*

## 📌 About  
This repository contains the implementation of a **modern redesign** for [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com) — one of the most popular platforms for competitive programming.  
The goal is to create a **clean, user-friendly, and responsive interface** that enhances the overall experience while preserving all existing functionality.

This project is being developed as a browser extension using **TypeScript**, React, and modern frontend tools, with the final build targeting JavaScript for compatibility with browser extension environments.
